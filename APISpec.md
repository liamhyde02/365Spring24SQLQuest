## 3.  

The API calls are made in this sequence when sending a character on a quest:

### 3.3 Character completes quest - `/quests/{char_id}/{quest_id}` (DELETE)

Remove an entry from the questing table and give the character rewards.
Note: This will be removing the questing entry, adding the gold reward, and adding the item reward
this must be done atomically, so I don't think we can separate this into 3 separate API calls

**Response**:

```json
{
    "success": "boolean"
}
```
