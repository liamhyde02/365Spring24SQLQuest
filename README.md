Project Description
Our project is SQL Quest (working name). It will function like an rpg
where characters go on quests to earn rewards to buy better gear
in order to take on harder quests for better rewards. We will have a 
front end site where players buy gear for their character and select quests. 
Our idea for quests is making a bunch of simple mini-games and then randomly 
selecting a subset of them for each quest with harder quests requiring more
mini-game wins.
